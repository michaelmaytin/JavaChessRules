<h1>RULES  OF  CHESS</h1>

<p>
    Terms: Ranks are the rows of squares that run horizontally on the Game Board and Files are the columns that run vertically.<br>
    Diagonals run diagonally.<br>
    Position the Game Board so that the red square is at the bottom right corner for each player.<br>
    Place the Ivory Play Pieces on the first rank from left to right in order: Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight and Rook.<br>
    Place all of the Pawns on the second rank.<br>
    Then place the Black Play Pieces on the board as shown in the diagram.<br>
    Note: the Ivory Queen will be on a red square and the black Queen will be on a black space.<br>
    Play: Ivory always plays first. Players alternate turns.<br>
    Only one Play Piece may be moved on a turn, except when castling (see description on back).<br>
    All Play Pieces must move in a straight path, except for the Knight.<br>
    Also, the Knight is the only Play Piece that is allowed to jump over another Play Piece.<br>
    Play Piece Moves: A Pawn moves forward one square at a time.<br>
    There are two exceptions to this rule:<br>
    1. On a Pawn’s first move, it can move forward one or two squares.<br>
    2. When capturing a piece (see description on back), a Pawn moves one square diagonally ahead.<br>
    At the beginning of the game, the Pawn is the least valuable Play Piece.<br>
    But, when a Pawn reaches the other side of the board it can be converted into any Play Piece except for the King.<br>
    The Knight is the only Play Piece that can jump over another Play Piece.<br>
    Knights move three squares at a time: two spaces forward or backward, then one space left or right, or two spaces to the left or right, then one space     forward or backward.<br>
    The move looks like the letter L.<br>
    The Knight always ends up landing on a square opposite the color from which it started.<br><br>

    Set Up:<br>
    The Bishop moves diagonally as many open squares as you like.<br>
    The Bishop must remain on the same color square as it started the game on.<br>
    The Rook moves in a straight line, horizontally or vertically as many open squares as you like.<br>
    Besides the Queen, the Rook is the next most powerful Play Piece.<br>
    The Queen is the most powerful of the Play Pieces.<br>
    The Queen moves in any direction (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) as many open squares as you like.<br>
    The King is the most important Play Piece, because if it becomes trapped, you’ll lose the game.<br>
    The King moves one square in any direction, as long as it doesn’t put itself in Check.<br>
    Check: You are in Check if an opponent’s Play Piece is in a position on the board to capture your King.<br>
    To save your King from Check you must do one of the following:<br>
    1. Move the King out of the way of the opponent’s Play Piece.<br>
    2. Move another one of your Play Pieces to block your opponent.<br>
    3. Capture the opponent’s Play Piece that is threatening your King.<br>
    Checkmate: When your King cannot be saved from Check, it’s called Checkmate and you lost the game.<br>
    Checkmate means “the King is dead” in Persian.<br>
    Capturing: When you move one of your Play Pieces and it ends on an opponent’s Play Piece, you capture it and remove it from the Game Board.<br>
    Capturing en passant: If a Pawn lands next to an opponent’s Pawn after moving two spaces on its first move, it can be captured en passant.<br>
    The opponent’s Pawn, on its next turn only, can be moved diagonally to the space behind the first Pawn, capturing it.<br>
    Castling: This is a special move for the King and either Rook and is the only time two Play Pieces can move on one turn.<br>
    It helps to protect the King and positions the Rook toward the center of the Game Board.<br>
    To castle, slide the Rook to the space next to the King.<br>
    Move the King to the other side of the Rook.<br>
    To castle:<br>
    1. This must be the first move for both the King and the Rook.<br>
    2. No other Play Pieces can be between the King and the Rook.<br>
    3. The King can’t be in Check, either before or after the castle.<br>
    4. The King can’t be in Check on any of the spaces that it passes over during the castle.<br><br>

    Winning:<br>
    If you put your opponent’s King in Check so he can’t escape, call Checkmate… you win!<br>
    Ties: If neither player can win, players can agree to draw.<br>
    Stalemate: If a player’s King is not in Check, but any possible move places him in Check, it’s a Stalemate
